## What is Stock Manager?

The aim is to design an application for financial portfolio management. The user, identified by his account, can access a global view of the stocks in which he has invested, as well as statistics to assess the performance of his investments. The application offers the possibility of adding or withdrawing specific shares and consulting the information associated with them. It does not allow you to buy or sell assets, and is geared more towards high-level management.
